# graphsql

A project building a graphQL server with Apollo and Slonik while working through the book 'Practical SQL'

A few goals:

1. gain deeper SQL knowledge
2. practice using apollo-server
3. test out slonik in place of pg/ typeorm
4. set up dev tools for raw sql in TS (syntax highlighting, linter, etc.)
5. figure out the 'graphql version' of the morgan logger
6. gain a clearer understanding of dataloader

I also want to test out the joi validator, but this may be unnecesary if all sql queries are filtered through graphql

I may build out a frontend ui later, but for now will focus on just the graphql server
