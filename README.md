# graphsql

A project building a graphQL server with Apollo and Slonik while working through the book 'Practical SQL'

A few goals:

- [x] gain deeper SQL knowledge
- [x] practice using apollo-server
- [x] test out slonik in place of pg/ typeorm
- [x] set up dev tools for raw sql in TS (syntax highlighting, linter, etc.)
- [x] figure out the 'graphql version' of the morgan logger
